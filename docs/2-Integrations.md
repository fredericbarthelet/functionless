### Integrations

`functionless` makes configuring services like AWS Step Functions and Appsync as easy as writing TypeScript functions. To get started, you only need to wrap your Constructs with the Functionless type-safe extension classes, `Function` and `Table`, and then write your business logic with `AppsyncResolver`, `StepFunction` or `ExpressStepFunction`.
